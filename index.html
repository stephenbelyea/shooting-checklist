			<h1>Shooting Checklist</h1>
			<article class="skype-call">
				<h2>Skype Calls</h2>
				<div class="col-half">
					<h3>Source (that's you):</h3>
					<p>It's always best to make sure your own setup is tip-top before your scheduled call, so be sure to set some time aside beforehand.</p>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Prep your space.</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>No major clutter in the background.</li>
							<li>No private photos, brand logos, or sensitive information visible.</li>
							<li>Lamps are handy and somewhat arranged.</li>
							<li>Door(s) and window(s) closed.</li>
							<li>Noisy electronics shut off or unplugged.</li>
							<li>Other noisy items removed from the room.</li>
							<li>Adjust your seat so that you're sitting up straight.</li>
							<li>Raise or lower the camera so that it's on eye level.</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Setup your tech.</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Set to record at 720p or 1080p.</li>
							<li>Audio is live and the levels are showing.</li>
							<li>Screen to be captured is isolated on its own monitor.</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Lights!</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Both sides of your face are lit and visible.</li>
							<li>No deep, harsh shadows from your nose or brow.</li>
							<li>No visible distracting light sources in the background.</li>
							<li>Background is reasonably, evenly lit.</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Camera!</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Camera is mounted on the monitor you'll be looking at.</li>
							<li>Top of your head close to top of the frame.</li>
							<li>Keep yourself centered.</li>
							<li>Mouth is clear and visible - not blocked by the mic.</li>
							<li>Remember that your frame will be tiny on screen, so fill it with your face.</li>
							<li>Take a minute to move your hands around and learn the edges of the frame.</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>How's it sound?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Grab headphones. You don't need them for recording if you nail the setup.</li>
							<li>You want clean, with no background hum or fuzz.</li>
							<li>Try some loud words and harsh letters (B, P, K, etc.) for popping.</li>
							<li>If you have levels, keep them from green to yellow. Avoid red.</li>
							<li>Try different mic settings. Cardiod (the heart shape) is likely best.</li>
							<li>Try alternate mic positions. Likely best in front of you and pointing toward your mouth.</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Run a test.</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Run a quick test clip. Speak, read notes and move the mouse, like you would during the interview.</li>
							<li>Listen to it with headphones.</li>
							<li>Watch to make sure you stay in the frame.</li>
							<li>Your lighting stays soft and even.</li>
							<li>Keep an eye out for flickering on your face from the screen.</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
				</div>
				<div class="col-half last">
					<h3>Guest (that's them).</h3>
					<p>Obviously, you won't have as much control over the guest's shot. Everybody wants to look good on camera, though, so don't be afraid to offer some guidance.</p>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Check the basics.</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>If their shot is upright (portrait), see if they can get on a laptop or desktop and get normal (landscape) framing.</li>
							<li>Is the picture decent quality?</li>
							<li>Is there enough light to make out the guest?</li>
							<li>Is the colour realistic? Not crazy blue or orange?</li>
							<li>Can you hear them reasonably well?</li>
							<li>How's the connection?</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Take a closer look.</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Is the shot distractingly messy or cluttered?</li>
							<li>Have they left any photos, logos, or sensitive material visible?</li>
							<li>Door(s) and window(s) closed?</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>How's the framing?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Are they mostly centered?</li>
							<li>Top of their head should be at or near the top of the frame.</li>
							<li>Mouth and eyes should be visible and clear.</li>
							<li>Are they sitting comfortably? Not too hunched or too stretched?</li>
							<li>Is the camera at eye level? They shouldn't be looking up or down at you.</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Help them light.</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Is their face well-lit?</li>
							<li>Soft, even light will look best - avoid harsh shadows.</li>
							<li>Any windows or distracting light sources visible?</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>How do they sound?</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Are your levels relatively balanced?</li>
							<li>If not, are they able to raise / lower their mic?</li>
							<li>Are you able to raise / lower yours to even out?</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
					<label>
						<input type="checkbox"><h4>Run another test.</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Get them talking - ask them how their day has been.</li>
							<li>Watch their movement and listen to their audio levels. If they naturally act or speak a certain way, you need to work around it.</li>
							<li>If they move around a lot, ask them to sit farther from the camera so they stay in frame.</li>
							<li>If their voice level jumps around, adjust low. The audio can always be bumped up in editing.</li>
							<li>How is the connection? If they cut out a lot, let them know that you may be asking them to repeat things.</li>
						</ul>
					</label>
				</div>
				<span class="clear"></span>
				<h3>While shooting...</h3>
				<p>Here's a couple of things to keep in mind while you're talking.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Watch your eyeline. If you need to look away, do it with your eyes and keep your head pointed at the camera.</li>
					<li>Careful with that mouse. Keep the recording screen isolated.</li>
					<li>Sit up straight. Don't slouch.</li>
					<li>Speak into the mic, and keep your voice steady. Watch the excited yelling or low mumbling.</li>
					<li>Slow it down. Take your time and get the words out.</li>
					<li>Let the guest speak. Your audience likes you, but they're tuning in to hear what the other person has to say.</li>
					<li>If they're speaking too much or lost the train of thought, step in and help out. No one likes looking foolish on camera.</li>
					<li>If you flub a line or mumble a question, repeat it. Pause and repeat the whole thing - not just half of the sentence.</li>
					<li>Same goes if the guest messes up. Let them try it again.</li>
					<li>If something goes wrong, don't sweat it. Take a second, stop recording if you need to. Get back to it with a clear head.</li>
					<li>Always leave padding. Give it space after hitting "record" and before hitting "stop".</li>
				</ul>
